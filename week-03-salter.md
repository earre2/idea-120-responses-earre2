In Chris Salter's exploration of modern art in "Entangled," there's this awesome mix of digital flair and good old-fashioned hands-on creativity. Picture artists diving into a wild blend of materials and complex machinery to craft experiences that not only hit your senses but tug at your emotions too. It's not just about looking at art; it's about feeling it, being part of the vibe, and getting a unique experience.  

Salter's vibe is all about breaking the mold. Artists use all sorts of tangible stuff — think sculptures and interactive installations — to create an immersive experience that goes beyond the ordinary. It's not just about what you see; it's about illusions that mess with your mind in the coolest way possible. Imagine a sculpture that moves when you least expect it or a room that reacts to your every move.  

And here's the tech twist Salter's into: artists use complex machinery to make these illusions rock-solid, and they play with electrical lighting to bring color into the mix. It's like a high-tech dance of the senses, emotions, and illusions, creating an art experience that's as real as it gets.
